                        <p>Our third technical summative had us following a wireframe
                            with full creative freedom on what we'll be doing for that
                            wireframe. I utilized a laundry service as my chosen business
                            because I had no idea what else to use. The summative had us
                            utilizing the Bootstrap framework in order to provide better
                            understanding regarding flexboxes and CSS grid, which is where
                            Bootstrap is built on, besides the responsiveness.

                        <hr>
                        <p>An assignment that was given to us that, upon completion, would
                            award us with an exemption in the Midterm Exam for our Web Design
                            with Client-Side Scripting subject. It involved animations, in
                            the form of a marquee, to scroll infinitely diagonally and horizontally.
                            It signaled a slight change in how we will be approaching CSS from that point
                            forwards. It was quite difficult making the marquee go indefinitely but
                            in the end, it paid off.

                        <p>One of the first optional assignments given to us, it had us create
                            any site as long as it involved a table system in a 3x4 grid. Being a
                            fan of the game Fate/Grand Order, I made use of the game's character art
                            in order to create a gallery for the servants that appear in the game.
                            Still being relatively new to CSS, it forced me to learn about position
                            properties, object fit, among others.
